A repository for some throw-away algorithmic code I wrote at some
point in my life. Because there's not enough useless stuff on GitHub
already.

* C
  * Parallel merge sort
* Haskell
  * Calculator for arithmetic expressions with an ad-hoc parser
    (written in high school; the code is rather ugly)
* OCaml
  * Huffman encoding (also written a very long time ago!)
  * Quadtree-based solution to a Prologin exercise (this is *not* the
    intended solution, but it works and its performance is good
    enough)
* Ruby
  * Optimal bitonic tour (a classic exercise from CLRS)
  * Maximum antichain in a finite poset (using bipartite maximum
    matching + Dilworth's theorem), applied to the divisibility order
    on positive integers
* Rust (old version, probably not compatible with the current one)
  * Knuth-Morris-Pratt string matching
  * Manacher's algorithm for the longest palindromic substring problem
    (with QuickCheck tests)
