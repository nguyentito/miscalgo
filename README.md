A repository for some throw-away algorithmic code I wrote at some
point in my life. Because there's not enough useless stuff on GitHub
already.

* Haskell
  * calculator for arithmetic expressions with an ad-hoc parser
    (written a very long time ago! the code is rather ugly)
* OCaml
  * Huffman encoding (written a very long time ago!)
  * Quadtree-based solution to a Prologin exercise (this is *not* the
    intended solution, but it works and its performance is good
    enough)
* Ruby
  * Optimal bitonic tour (a classic exercise from CLRS)
  * Maximum antichain in a finite poset (using maximum matching +
    Dilworth's theorem), applied to the divisibility order on positive integers
* Rust
  * Knuth-Morris-Pratt string matching
  * Manacher's algorithm for the longest palindromic substring problem
    (with QuickCheck tests)
